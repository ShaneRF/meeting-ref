[2024/08/21 17:01:31] Let’s just open this file and start talking about it. OK, let’s start with this.

[2024/08/21 17:04:02] The content of the translated words is too long now. At the beginning, I used the model to translate the lyrics. Now I am using that model to translate it. I have put it all on and then I will explain tomorrow. It's the same thing in the afternoon, so I'll test it tomorrow afternoon and shoot a video. That's it, and then, and then.

[2024/08/21 17:04:17] I will buy a headset. Then I will directly use the headset to measure the conversation between two people and then record the video. This will be basically the same then. Basically

[2024/08/21 17:04:37] That’s the one to join from LINEBAR. Then in LINEBAR, I will let you fill in some information and then after joining, I will use it again. I will send the invitation to you again, and then there is the dialogue car.

[2024/08/21 17:04:58] And then the manual speed test and the reflection test, well, it’s pretty accurate, because there is none. The most important thing now is that I don’t want it. I’m just telling you this. I know that I’m the most The main thing is to see if there is any way to expose the situation.

[2024/08/21 17:05:47] Look, it’s very noisy now. He’s still moving quite well now... This is so weak. It’s okay. It’s okay. I think... because I really want to tell you this. I’ll let it go later. Go up, the file is really big, 1.5G, yes, that’s why I said this is the one from that time... It seems more accurate if you click down and write the right one. You just looked at the post-production like this and said, if you want to use it, you can Using this, I will test some first and string it together.

[2024/08/21 17:06:00] Cool, cool, this is pretty accurate. Wisper doesn’t have it because the previous one would miss characters. Even if you send it to Google for payment, it will still miss characters. If you pay for this, you don’t need to put money in the principal.

[2024/08/21 17:06:18] No, Dang, no, because it’s too big, right, but then you, you use the video, the video is not wrong, you are recording and playing the video

[2024/08/21 17:06:39] You can go down and convert the subtitles, and now it’s real-time recording and immediately convert to text. You can see that the text is not lost now. I think it’s quite fun, but it’s very fat because the model is all down.

[2024/08/22 09:48:23] I will try my best to be the third one. I didn’t pull it just now. I was very stinky just now. Brother Ping’s experiment made me stinky. By the way, my goal is to be the queen. My goal I just did this on Douban. Come on, start, take a step

Flash web is light installation. You can convert it to light installation. This is relatively simple. Let’s look at this. flash webGive me a good spaceGive me a good spaceGive me a good spaceGive me a good spaceGive me a good spaceGive me a good spaceDon't go forwardBesidesThere is another one like convert everythingConvert this projectUsually all of us We are doing hard work software and we will use this flash web flash web this flash web is the same as this we can use this we can use this we can use this we can use this this this can shorten shorten this this is our

[2024/08/22 11:39:53] That’s itThe price of the venue is because of the shooting, but in fact there are many single shooting master shooting users, then this is wrong. It is the fish you are collecting and the fish net of that one. This is good. Use shooting to shoot. There are two behind it. Gekko often uses Ji Guo and Ji Guo Standard. The thing about Ji Guo Standard is that it is actually a certain fish, so it is too cold but relatively good fish.

[2024/08/22 11:40:28] The CinemaLite used is a little different from the previous programs because it uses file text, so it is probably necessary to use this in general.

[2024/08/22 11:40:48] I went there using PHS, yes, he has a problem. Then I really became CM, I am quite synthetic.

[2024/08/22 11:41:42] My problem is that I don’t have AI because it can’t be used. There is no way to use Python. In fact, there is no way for us to call Python in PSC. That’s a big problem. There is also one now. The angle is that we use external faults. External enterprises use external faults to do it. We know this. You may be forced to say, I'm going to help me with this PythonPython.

[2024/08/22 11:41:50]

[2024/08/22 11:54:03] Everyone, there are still a few minutes now. We can write a simple question. We write a simple question. Now it can be kept at hand. We use the structure of the classroom matrix. It Don't be afraid of the upper body, it turns out to be very simple

[2024/08/22 11:54:30] You can see agony or anyone Yaz come out

[2024/08/22 11:55:56] Yeah, this is the amount of work that is done.

[2024/08/22 11:56:16] Assumed. Okay, that was to help create the

[2024/08/22 11:56:35] In this way, there are only two simplest methods. This structure? Retreat first. For example, if you can activate DM, then you can allocate other people’s information to the camera. Then you can come in. Can the two and a half lengths be simply two and a half lengths?

[2024/08/22 11:56:55] Okay, then click on D1D1CodeCodeC8 and enter EnterEnterEnterWireWireWire. The latter one is quite important, so just change this program.

[2024/08/22 11:57:35] Uh, he's not. Okay. Well, for the best. That's it. Thanks. What? I'm sorry.

[2024/08/22 11:58:36] memo

[2024/08/22 13:29:20] Another one is that this method is very simple. What we use today is a control column built in VSCode. It is different from the mid-range wheel. This control column is for you to control. This calls the VSCode built-in

[2024/08/22 13:29:23] A wet window with one function is good, but how to open it?

[2024/08/22 13:29:33] Please press Ctrl Shift plus PCtrl Shift plus P to change this

[2024/08/22 13:30:28] This is considered as its built-in interrupt built-in control force. Call it out. Which package you use in the future is that it has some instructions. The instructions of the package are to be input in This kind of interface is not the interrupt we usually use. What about this side? Maybe your first one is not the Python function. That doesn't matter. You are here. It must have a big feather. If you delete the big feather, it is just a it. It will become a non-meeting, such as browsing and interacting with the information you have captured so far. Then we have to confirm every time we open it.

[2024/08/22 13:30:42] When we are executing in the audience, is there a big language symbol? There is a big language symbol that means we are going to ask VS Code now. We are going to interact with some of the VS Code installations. Tool We also plan to shoot in this tool

[2024/08/22 13:32:36] Select the interpreter or select the interpreter like the content in my English. You will see an interface called like this below. What I mean is When you turn on this function, it will call the interface of the entire interpreter. If you still remember, it is actually the same as last time. Go to PREAD to determine the problem and then select yours to select the interpreter.

[2024/08/22 13:33:46] Thank you.

[2024/08/22 13:33:48] Thank you.

[2024/08/22 13:33:55] Thank you.

[2024/08/22 13:34:17] I recorded the process of overcoming it, then record it here like our previous course notes.

[2024/08/22 13:34:24] tickets made a subscribethrough a

[2024/08/22 13:34:57] We open the parser and select this screen of the parser. This parser is actually the version of your Python and other knowledge here because we need to establish our corresponding version of the virtual environment. So the way we press the selection is to press the first Gradient Preview

[2024/08/22 13:35:09] Okay, then the first option that comes in will ask you which form of this virtual link you want to organize. We chose BENV. Okay, what next?

[2024/08/22 13:43:16]

[2024/08/22 13:43:37] What about us? Now that the virtual environment has been established, let’s enable the virtual environment first. Then let’s start the part of enabling the virtual environment directly.

[2024/08/22 13:50:04] We don’t need to deliberately adjust the preset execution program version of this mid-range machine. We can just use Parser. Then the execution method of the mid-range machine is enabled. That is, we go directly to the BDNV folder and enter the path using character completion. Now, if I want to enter the virtual environment of a mid-range machine, it will be reasonable to enable the program command of this Activity. Then it will Let's let our mid-range machine enter the virtual environment. Then let's enter this folder to execute this command and this method of executing this script. You can type BDNV first. You can type BDNV and press Tab. It will automatically Help us fill in the correct way of writing the path that should be on the front corresponding to the Parser of this mid-range machine. It will automatically help us correct it. Then the next page is Scrip. We need to go to Scrip and then see what you want. What is the version of your mid-range machine? It seems that I use Parser and what you want to execute is Activity.ps1. Then you use Command Promote to execute this BAP. If you are Linux or Mac, this is Activity without Parser. For the script, I wrote the AST like this Activity.ps1. Then you will see that if you execute it for the first time on the school computer, it will not be trusted by the publisher. That’s okay. Let’s press Always Execute and select A. Well, this is the safe one. C is good, then you are the same as the Command Promote. If you have an agent enter the virtual environment, you should see information like VNV. Okay, then when you enter VNV, we have to do one thing first, which is to change our Python then needs to execute Python Mac.py. First check your current environment and the program you wrote last time. Can you move it well? Then if you see the last content and fill it in, you should goWhen you grab a new article, it will print out another part directly. It will also analyze the JSON, JSONPTT and JSON in the project folder because we have to put all the process of grabbing the data in it.

[2024/08/22 15:22:32] Because you just talked about the last paragraph, you don’t need it now. The previous ones are not used anymore, that is, the ones here are not guaranteed. These are not used here. These and above are not needed.
